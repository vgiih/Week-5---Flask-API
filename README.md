Week-5
This ML Project was based on a challenge I had some time ago:

"Our goal is to be able to predict the sales (in millions of dollars) that we will have in a given period based on spending on ads in the 3 major networks that the company Hashtag invests: TV, Newspaper and Radio (in thousands of dollars)"

With this project I already had, I pickled the best model, which was RandomForestRegressor and deployed it on a website with Flask.
